Worked on my resume.

Fixed the AI call center project, mostly learning how to write good software. I would say experience working in a big company helps people write good software. I need to learn more about how to create good software.

Went to the ACM student club. I want to build connections with this ACM club and ACM.

Tried installing and integrating Apeach Airflow with MySQL on Mac - unsuccessful.

Worried about the future and current work.

### March 28, 2025 (Friday)

For the 'Jacket Research Project,' one teammate showed up ðŸ¥². Focused on building a project with Claude MCP.

This is a small-scale project. I wonder if I can fully build the project with Claude. I want to finish this before the semester ends because I am in charge of it anyway. But also, when people don't show up, it is kind of disappointing. I felt less energized.

Worked hard to finish data pipeline automation using Apeach Airflow! Partially successful. It took so long.

### March 29, 2025 (Saturday)

Worked long hours on the Call Center Project with S (teammate). It always feels good when I learn how to build good software.

Spent a long time looking into generated code and decided to implement the page from scratch. AI-generated code looks good but does not work without understanding it.

**Learned how to build a frontend!!** Implement the API first and test it, build the basic structure, and start implementing visual features.

It is really nice to hear how people create software in a big company. I like their structured approach.

I want to work in a big company with structure because learning by myself is useful, but it is way faster to learn how to work in the industry in a big company. I hope I can gain experience working in an organization at a production level, even in the Open Source Community.

Looked into GSoC. Realized I should have started contacting organizations way earlier. I wish I had known this beforehand.

I always feel I am one step behind and realize everything a bit laterâ€”not too late, but late enough to make my life harder.

But I am always trying.

[Class]  
Read an article about auditory sensing and human perception. It is fascinating that human perception can be affected by prior knowledge.

Worked on a programming language concept assignment. It feels good when I finally understand a concept that I previously did not know.

Applied for GSoC. It is more competitive than I thought. I hope I get accepted and learn how to build production-level software.
