[ Lerobot SO-101 parts sourcing research - completed / 4H ] 

- Why
    1. Seeking to build two SO-101 robot arm sets before the Lerobot hackathon in June
    2. Find ways to reduce the budget as purchasing two SO-101 sets in the States is not feasible due to tariffs and shipping fees. Official links provide links for parts but they're overpriced, especially in USD. With shipping fees and tariffs, this robot arm becomes inaccessible to students (~$350+ each). (The original robot arm was accessible at around $100)
- How
    1. Checked the sourcing document and necessary parts list
    2. Reviewed official stores and links to understand full electronic parts set requirements
    3. Researched motor specs and models on Alibaba to find the exact same motors
    4. Researched parts on AliExpress to find ways to source each individual component separately, ensuring each purchase and shipment remains under the duty-free threshold
- Result
    1. Able to reduce significant amount of money for motors ($260 Ã— 2 + shipping fee + import fee â†’ $400 in total for motors + need to purchase PSU)
- Downside
    1. Requires longer shipping and processing time
    2. Need to make separate purchases several times
- Next
    1. Make purchases under the threshold
    2. Wait for deliveries

    3. I want to learn more about WebXR technology to build an interactive demo.

    2. Installed Unity and Meta Quest Development Hub.
    3. Read through documentation.
