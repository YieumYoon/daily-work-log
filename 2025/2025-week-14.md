[Class]  
Learning Haskell language.  

It is interesting to see that programming and math look similar, but on a deeper level, math is nice and clean, while programming has to consider many factors like memory allocation, interpreters, the intention of the programming language, how variables are handled, etc. I asked this question in class, and the professor said that because programming is engineering, it is different from math. Math makes many assumptions.  

Finished engineering class lecture videos.  

Started fall class selection. There are so many programming classes that I am interested in, but due to the amount of time I have, I need to set priorities.  

[Personal]  
Worked on my personal diary. Trying to get back on track.

[Personal]  
I spent 3 hours today searching for an SFF (small form factor) computer case. Actually, I have been looking for the computer case I want to have. Initially, I was planning to build a classic-style SFF computer case with 3D printing. However, I realized I need some reference, and also, I want to focus on other things for now, so I pushed that project back for later.

I browsed through Aliexpress, Taobao, Google, and many other websites. In the end, I realized there isn't anything that is both good and budget-friendly. If I want something with good aesthetics and features, I need to pay more—possibly much more. Even cheap computer cases aren't truly cheap. Either I spend time searching through websites, sacrifice space due to the case's size, or accept that the price isn't much lower than a high-quality SFF case.

I feel like I wasted too much time on this. It's probably better to focus on finding ways to make more money rather than spending hours looking for cheaper options. My time is the most valuable resource.

I've decided to buy the expensive SFF case that I actually want. I don't want to settle for something of lower quality unless it's significantly cheaper. I should have just purchased what I wanted initially. I won't repeat this mistake.

Making more money—that is the way.


사실 순수한 관심을 가지고 주제에 대해서 더 알고싶어서 공부를 한다는 것은 굉장한 사치가 아닐까? 사용하지는 않지만 알고싶은 것들 말이다. 아무 곳에도 적용하지는 않고 실용적이지 않지만 관심있어서 공부하는것은 얼마나 즐겁고 힐링이 될까

[Thoughts / Ideas]
We humans learn not just by observing others' actions, but by intuiting the intentions behind them. What if AI models could evolve beyond mimicking behaviors to actually inferring the underlying motivations and reasoning that drive human decisions? This deeper understanding might be the bridge between programmed intelligence and genuine comprehension.

### April 5, 2025 (Saturday)
Took a Fractal Terra assembly video from a top-down view. I plan to upload it on YouTube—my first attempt at becoming a video creator.

Borrowed a tripod and a Rode mic from the school library. I also thought about lighting and experimented with two lights. I hope this setup gives a cinematic feel.

The video is an hour long, so I will need to edit it.

[ETC]  
Still no job offers for the summer. Hmm...

### April 6, 2025 (Sunday)

After finishing building the computer, I installed Nvidia Isaac Sim. I wanted to try it, and it works on the computer. However, training does not work due to GPU limitations.
