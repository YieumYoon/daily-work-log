[Class]  
Learning Haskell language.  

It is interesting to see that programming and math look similar, but on a deeper level, math is nice and clean, while programming has to consider many factors like memory allocation, interpreters, the intention of the programming language, how variables are handled, etc. I asked this question in class, and the professor said that because programming is engineering, it is different from math. Math makes many assumptions.  

Finished engineering class lecture videos.  

Started fall class selection. There are so many programming classes that I am interested in, but due to the amount of time I have, I need to set priorities.  

[Personal]  
Worked on my personal diary. Trying to get back on track.
