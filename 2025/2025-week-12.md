## Daily Log  

### March 17, 2025 (Monday)  

Worked on the call center AI project chat page.

- Created `apiService.ts` to handle backend communication
- Updated chat interface in `page.tsx` to track user sessions
- Implemented ID management system (user, module, thread)
- Added mock implementations for missing backend APIs
- Created documentation for frontend and required backend endpoints

I had a team meeting for the call center project. I am glad I changed the interface completely; I did not like the previous interface.

The requirements are not clear, so I thought, what if I let Claude 3.7 create the interface and system with vague requirements?

I generated the code for the chat page without asking for something specific. After a few attempts with the same prompt, I was satisfied with the interface design and the features, so I decided to stick to the code.

I wanted to finish the chat page implementation, so I vibe-coded it. Most of the time, I tried to understand the code, but that took a long time. Now vibe coding seems to work for prototyping. What should I do? Vibe code to finish the product or try to understand the code deeply?

I created the readme.md files for the `apiService.ts` and `page.tsx` because it is hard to know what I have done and what api needs to be created in the backend without documentation.

And also, I created this daily log page too! I will experiment with the format.
