## Daily Log  

### March 17, 2025 (Monday)  

Worked on the call center AI project chat page.

- Created `apiService.ts` to handle backend communication
- Updated chat interface in `page.tsx` to track user sessions
- Implemented ID management system (user, module, thread)
- Added mock implementations for missing backend APIs
- Created documentation for frontend and required backend endpoints

I had a team meeting for the call center project. I am glad I changed the interface completely; I did not like the previous interface.

The requirements are not clear, so I thought, what if I let Claude 3.7 create the interface and system with vague requirements?

I generated the code for the chat page without asking for something specific. After a few attempts with the same prompt, I was satisfied with the interface design and the features, so I decided to stick to the code.

I wanted to finish the chat page implementation, so I vibe-coded it. Most of the time, I tried to understand the code, but that took a long time. Now vibe coding seems to work for prototyping. What should I do? Vibe code to finish the product or try to understand the code deeply?

I created the readme.md files for the `apiService.ts` and `page.tsx` because it is hard to know what I have done and what APIs need to be created in the backend without documentation.

And also, I created this daily log page too! I will experiment with the format.

Watched three YouTube videos about video taking and editing as I also want to log my project in video format. But, I don't want to just make videos with poor quality. I know I am new to video making but want to have some tone and style that are aesthetically appealing somewhat.

What style and tone would people like? I personally prefer mid-century modern style but I will think about my target and current trend.

I searched the current design trend with Perplexity Pro and I think mid-century modern style matches the current design trend so I will use it!

Also, I looked into Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Read through the contributor guide. I found the Google developer Discord link at the end of the guide too!

I will look into the list of projects that I can work on and interest me and probably apply to three at most as applying to multiple projects is not recommended based on the guide.
