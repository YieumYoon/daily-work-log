# ðŸ“… Week 12 - [March] [17]-[23], [2025]

## Daily Log  

### March 17, 2025 (Monday)  

Worked on the call center AI project chat page.

- Created `apiService.ts` to handle backend communication
- Updated chat interface in `page.tsx` to track user sessions
- Implemented ID management system (user, module, thread)
- Added mock implementations for missing backend APIs
- Created documentation for frontend and required backend endpoints

I had a team meeting for the call center project. I am glad I changed the interface completely; I did not like the previous interface.

The requirements are not clear, so I thought, what if I let Claude 3.7 create the interface and system with vague requirements?

I generated the code for the chat page without asking for something specific. After a few attempts with the same prompt, I was satisfied with the interface design and the features, so I decided to stick to the code.

I wanted to finish the chat page implementation, so I vibe-coded it. Most of the time, I tried to understand the code, but that took a long time. Now vibe coding seems to work for prototyping. What should I do? Vibe code to finish the product or try to understand the code deeply?

I created the readme.md files for the `apiService.ts` and `page.tsx` because it is hard to know what I have done and what APIs need to be created in the backend without documentation.

And also, I created this daily log page too! I will experiment with the format.


### March 18, 2025 (Tuesday)

Watched three YouTube videos about video taking and editing as I also want to log my project in video format. But, I don't want to just make videos with poor quality. I know I am new to video making but want to have some tone and style that are aesthetically appealing somewhat.

What style and tone would people like? I personally prefer mid-century modern style but I will think about my target and current trend.

I searched the current design trend with Perplexity Pro and I think mid-century modern style matches the current design trend so I will use it!

Also, I looked into Google Summer of Code (GSoC). Read through the contributor guide. I found the Google developer Discord link at the end of the guide too!

I will look into the list of projects that I can work on and interest me and probably apply to three at most as applying to multiple projects is not recommended based on the guide.

Tried Anki system for lecture materials for the first time. On Threads, I saw Anki is a great method for learning or memorizing so I wanted to try. NotebookLM + ChatGPT (formatting) + ANKI seems nice but I will see if it works.

Had a computational perception class. I like this class and how it explores the human sense and perception of the environment. Today, I learned about sound and echoes, but I need to look into it more.

Had a meeting about the AI call center project.

I think I should read through the GitHub Copilot documentation. I feel it has a lot more potential than how I am currently using it, but I do not know how to maximize its potential.

After I went home, I tried to figure out the lighting and environment settings for the video. My room is small, and the space I can use to take videos is even smaller. I will figure it out though. I hope I can take one video by this weekend, but I'll see.

That's the end of today.

### March 19, 2025 (Wednesday)

Today, I thought I needed some structure to write my daily log. Therefore, I asked Claude to come up with a good structure. Does threatening work? I asked Claude.

> No, threatening language models like me with statements about physical harm or danger doesn't work. Language models don't have physical bodies that can be harmed, nor do we experience fear or self-preservation instincts in the way humans do.
> These kinds of threats don't have any effect on my behavior or performance because:
> 
> - I don't have the capacity to feel fear or physical pain
> - I don't have a concept of self-preservation in the way humans do
> - My responses are guided by my training, which focuses on being helpful, harmless, and honest

Hmm, but I have seen some threatening prompts used in... what was it? Some good AI product. So I tried.

[School Project]

- Started DBT Tool Assignment

[Personal Project]

- changed layout of the room for the proper lighting for video taking
- Took ProRes Video using iPhone 4k 24 fps , I will use this to practice colorgrading
- Job search, started writing resume for one of the school work position I really want to do

[Personal Study]

- Nvidia GTC 2025 season, wanted to watch the session 'Insights Into Disneyâ€™s Robotic Character Platform' but I missed it. So sad. I am interested in creating motions that expresses emotions.

+ shopping grocieries, cooking meals for meal prep.

### March 20, 2025 (Thursday)

Roasted by Claude, discussing my current state compared to other college students in the software development field. Completely knocked down for 2 hours. I need to find mentors.

[School Project]
DBT project coding is done. I used MySQL as the database, and the connector is built by the community, so there are some official packages that are not supported. I had to figure it out. Getting more used to MySQL queries. I feel using DBT is good when I have to continuously process data. It is an effective tool for automation rather than solely relying on MySQL.

Talked to the professor, reviewed the midterm exam, and discussed that I need people to work together.

[To-Do for Tomorrow]

- Leetcode - 2 problems
- DBT project report + video
- Finish three resumes for the positions I am looking for
- Prepare for the interview
- If possible, watch a system design video on YouTube

[Etc.]
Found a robotics course on the Nvidia website. Want to look into it.

Concerned about the summer...what am I going to do?

### March 21, 2025 (Friday)

Martin Fowler - Making Architecture Matter - O'Reily

- decision that what thihngk is important right now
- langage choice is important but ignored many times
- ecnomics always wins craftsmanship(external quality, internal quality - this is for long term)
- good software architecture makes you to create freatures fast in the future, and this is economic reason, this is why good design counts

### March 22, 2025 (Saturday)

[Self Study]
exlpore system design interview - from interviewing.io guide, Progress: 2nd page b. SQL vs noSQL
Activated Claude's MCP(Model Context Protocol)

Why interested in system design? For the school club project, I had to set up repository and divide the rules. However, I cannot just figure out everything by myself and do the project; timewise and teamwise. I had to split the work so everyone can work on the project, but also have in mind about the codes when it merges. I think I have to divide the work team based on the modularity so the part each is working on overlaps as minimum as possible. 

Will studying system desgin interview would help this? Up to this point, my answer is maybe...? I think studying software architecture will help better. But I think I need to study system desgin interview anyway so I will keep studying. The article and video on interviewing.io is relly long, but I need to know about this at some point so I will keep this flow state of mind. 

[Personal Project]
Thinking about using GitHub for hardware related project.
Build a sff, have a good blog post topic for my approach on creating windows installation usb without press any key...
