# 📝 My Developer Work Log  

🎄Welcome to my **daily work log 🪵 repository**! This is where I record **daily/weekly work log** as a developer—whether it's coding, debugging, learning something new, or just vibing with the latest AI tools. 🪄 

## 📖 Why I Created This Work Log  

This repository is **TMI** for most people, but honestly, that’s the whole point! 😆  

I realized that if I want to be a **professional**, I need to **keep track of my work**. I’ve tried **writing in a physical A5 diary**, but let’s be real—I lost interest after a few days. Keeping a work log **just for myself** felt like too much effort with no reward.  

But then today, **March 17, 2025**—the first Monday after my **week-long spring break in Chicago** (I saw the **green river** for St. Patrick’s Day! 🍀)—I was working on an **AI call center project** when I had a lightbulb moment. 💡  

I already **write tons of Markdown** for LLMs, documentation, and tracking what **Claude 3.7** worked on.

So I thought:  

👉 **What if I just put my daily work log on GitHub using Markdown format?**  
👉 **What if someone visiting my profile could see my progress?**  

I love **keeping records** because I know I’ll forget **so many details** in the future. Having a history of my work will make me feel **proud of my progress** (or… mildly depressed if I see I haven’t done much for a few days 😅).  

But yeah, that’s why I created this repo! 🚀
